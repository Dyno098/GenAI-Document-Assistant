## Architecture & Reasoning Flow

### 1. Document Upload
- PDF or TXT uploaded via `streamlit.file_uploader`
- Saved to `uploaded_docs/`
- Text extracted using PyMuPDF (for PDF) or simple `.read()` (for TXT)

### 2. Summary
- First ~2000 characters sent to a summarization model (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`)  
- Summary is shown immediately

### 3. Ask Anything (QA Mode)
- User asks free-form question
- Gemini is prompted with:
  ```
  Document: <text>
  Question: <user input>
  Answer based only on document.
  ```
- Gemini responds with contextually grounded answer

### 4. Challenge Me (Logic Questions)
- Gemini is asked to generate exactly 3 logical questions:
  ```
  Generate 3 logic-based questions based on the document. Number them.
  ```
- Streamlit form collects user's answers

### 5. Feedback & Evaluation
- Each answer is sent with:
  ```
  Document: <text>
  Question: <q>
  User Answer: <a>
  Evaluate: Is it correct? Justify based only on the document.
  ```
- Gemini returns correctness + justification

## Notes

- Make sure your Gemini key has access to `gemini-1.5-flash`
- Avoid uploading extremely large files (>30K tokens)
